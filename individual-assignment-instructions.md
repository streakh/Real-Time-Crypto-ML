(Individual) Programming Assignment: Detecting Crypto Volatility in Real Time
Executive Overview
You will build a real-time data pipeline that connects to Coinbase’s Advanced Trade WebSocket API, collects live market data, and streams it to Kafka. You’ll process this data into features, train models to detect short-term volatility spikes, log your experiments to MLflow, and generate an Evidently report to monitor data quality and drift. You’ll deliver three milestones over three weeks.

What You’ll Do
You will build a real-time data pipeline that connects to Coinbase’s Advanced Trade WebSocket API, collects live market data, and streams it to Kafka. You’ll process this data into features, train models to detect short-term volatility spikes, log your experiments to MLflow, and generate an Evidently report to monitor data quality and drift.

Learning Goals
Streaming & packaging: Stream data via Kafka and run services with Docker Compose.
Features & analysis: Build a reliable, reproducible feature pipeline and explore the data.
Modeling & tracking: Train and log baseline and ML models using MLflow; monitor drift with Evidently.
Tools You Must Use
Language: Python 3.10+
Streaming: Kafka (KRaft) via Docker Compose
Tracking: MLflow (local SQLite backend or containerized)
Drift & Quality Reporting: Evidently (HTML or JSON reports)
Data Storage: NDJSON, Parquet, or SQLite
Secrets: Never commit secrets. Use .env files or environment variables.
Note: This assignment uses public market data only. Do not place trades.
Milestone Breakdown
Milestone 1: Streaming Setup & Scoping
Goal: Get Kafka and MLflow running. Ingest data and define your problem.

Tasks: - Launch Kafka and MLflow using Docker Compose. - Ingest Coinbase WebSocket ticker data for 1–2 trading pairs (e.g., BTC-USD). - Ensure reconnect/resubscribe and heartbeats are implemented. - Publish incoming ticks to the Kafka topic ticks.raw. Optionally mirror to data/raw/. - Write a Kafka consumer to validate your stream. - Write a one-page Scoping Brief: use case, 60-second prediction goal, success metric, and risk assumptions. - Containerize your ingestor with Dockerfile.ingestor.

Deliverables: - docker/compose.yaml, docker/Dockerfile.ingestor - scripts/ws_ingest.py and scripts/kafka_consume_check.py - docs/scoping_brief.pdf - config.yaml (if used)

What to test: - docker compose ps shows all services running. - Running ws_ingest.py for 15 minutes yields messages in ticks.raw. - Container builds and runs successfully.

Milestone 2: Feature Engineering, EDA & Evidently
Goal: Build a Kafka consumer that computes features and generate your first data report.

Tasks: - Build features/featurizer.py (Kafka consumer) to compute windowed features like: - midprice returns, bid-ask spread, trade intensity (optionally order-book imbalance). - Output to Kafka topic ticks.features and also save to Parquet. - Build a replay script: take saved raw data, regenerate features identically. - Conduct EDA in a notebook. Use percentile plots to set a spike threshold. - Create your first Evidently report comparing early and late windows of data.

Deliverables: - features/featurizer.py, scripts/replay.py - data/processed/features.parquet, notebooks/eda.ipynb - docs/feature_spec.md including:

Target horizon: 60s
Volatility proxy: rolling std of midprice returns over the next horizon
Label definition: 1 if σ_future >= τ; else 0
Chosen threshold τ: <value>  (justify via plots)

reports/evidently/ with HTML/JSON report
What to test: - Replay and live consumer should yield identical features. - Evidently report includes drift and data quality.

 

Milestone 3: Modeling, Tracking, Evaluation
Goal: Train a model, log everything, and compare to a baseline.

Tasks: - Train one baseline model (e.g., z-score rule) and one ML model (e.g., Logistic Regression or XGBoost). - Use time-based train → validation → test splits. - Log your parameters, metrics, and model artifacts to MLflow. - Metrics must include: PR-AUC (required); optionally F1@threshold. - Write a Model Card v1. - Generate a fresh Evidently report comparing test vs training distribution.

Deliverables: - models/train.py, models/infer.py, and models/artifacts/ - reports/model_eval.pdf, refreshed Evidently report - docs/model_card_v1.md, docs/genai_appendix.md

What to test: - MLflow UI shows at least 2 runs (baseline and ML). - infer.py scores in < 2x real-time for your windows. - Evaluation report includes PR-AUC.

 

Quick Commands (Example)
# 0) Start Kafka + MLflow
$ docker compose up -d

# 1) Ingest 15 minutes of ticks
$ python scripts/ws_ingest.py --pair BTC-USD --minutes 15

# 2) Check messages in Kafka
$ python scripts/kafka_consume_check.py --topic ticks.raw --min 100

# 3) Build features
$ python features/featurizer.py --topic_in ticks.raw --topic_out ticks.features

# 4) Replay raw to verify feature consistency
$ python scripts/replay.py --raw data/raw/*.ndjson --out data/processed/features.parquet

# 5) Train and evaluate
$ python models/train.py --features data/processed/features.parquet
$ python models/infer.py  --features data/processed/features_test.parquet

 

Handoff to Team Project
Create a /handoff/ folder. Your team will either: - Use your model as the base, OR - Create a composite from the best parts of all team members.

You must include: - docker/compose.yaml, Dockerfile.ingestor, .env.example - docs/feature_spec.md, docs/model_card_v1.md - models/artifacts/, requirements.txt - A 10-minute raw slice + its features - reports/model_eval.pdf, Evidently report, and one predictions file - A short note: “Selected-base” OR “Composite” with exact steps
