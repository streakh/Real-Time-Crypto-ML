# BTC Volatility Spike Detector

## Quick Start

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @handoff/data_sample/sample.json
```

Real time crypto ML service that streams Coinbase style ticks into Kafka, generates rolling window features, and serves predictions via a FastAPI API. The system runs end to end in replay mode with Prometheus and Grafana monitoring, and supports rollback using MODEL_VARIANT.

## Canonical startup

### Environment

```bash
cp .env.example .env   # optional: override defaults
docker compose up -d
# Wait ~30s for Kafka and MLflow init, then:
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

Use this root README together with the root `docker-compose.yaml` as the only startup guide for the team project.

No manual model registration is required on a fresh clone — a one-shot
`mlflow-init` container logs the trained pipeline to MLflow and promotes
it to `Production` automatically, and the `api` gates on that completing.
See [First-Time Setup in the runbook](docs/runbook.md#first-time-setup)
for the verification commands and notes on the shared `mlflow-data`
volume.

## Quick Test

The prediction API boundary is **post-featurization**: `/predict` accepts the seven engineered 60-second features produced by the featurizer, not raw Coinbase tick messages.

> **API schema note:** The `/predict` endpoint accepts the 7 engineered features the model was trained on (see [`handoff/docs/feature_spec.md`](handoff/docs/feature_spec.md)). This is a post-featurization boundary and differs from the 3-field illustrative example in the assignment spec — per instructor guidance, the schema must match the trained model's features.

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/predict \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d @handoff/data_sample/sample.json
```

The `sample.json` payload contains one feature row (row 1 of `handoff/data_sample/features_slice.csv`):

```json
{
  "rows": [{
    "log_return": 0.0,
    "spread_bps": 0.0014345986913609724,
    "vol_60s": 0.0,
    "mean_return_60s": 0.0,
    "trade_intensity_60s": 0.016666666666666666,
    "n_ticks_60s": 1,
    "spread_mean_60s": 0.010000000009313226,
    "ts": "2026-04-06T15:02:34.590029Z"
  }]
}
```

Expected response (`ts` is UTC wall-clock at inference time):

```json
{
  "scores": [0.10401],
  "model_variant": "ml",
  "version": "v1.0",
  "ts": "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.ffffffZ"
}
```

`/version` always returns the same metadata shape, with `stage` and `run_id` set to `null` when the API falls back to the local pickle artifact:

```json
{
  "model": "btc-volatility-lr",
  "version": "v1.0",
  "stage": "Production",
  "source": "mlflow",
  "run_id": "RUN_ID_OR_NULL",
  "sha": "GIT_SHA"
}
```

The system runs fully in replay mode by default, ensuring reproducibility without external dependencies.

## Data Ingestion Modes

The default `docker compose up -d` runs the replay ingestor, which loops a 10 minute Coinbase capture through Kafka at original timestamps. This ensures reproducibility without external dependencies.

To switch to live ingestion from Coinbase public WebSocket:

```bash
docker compose stop ingestor
docker compose --profile live up -d ws-ingestor
```

Both ingestion modes publish to the same `ticks.raw` Kafka topic, so only one should run at a time.


## Endpoints and Dashboards

| Service | URL | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| API | http://localhost:8000 | `/health`, `/predict`, `/version`, `/metrics` |
| MLflow | http://localhost:5001 | Training-run tracking |
| Prometheus | http://localhost:9090 | Scrapes API + kafka-exporter |
| Grafana | http://localhost:3000 | Anonymous viewer; dashboard "BTC Volatility Detector — API" |

## Rollback

To switch from the LR model to the deterministic baseline rule:

```bash
MODEL_VARIANT=baseline docker compose up -d api
curl -s http://localhost:8000/version | jq .source   # → "pickle"
```

Roll forward with `MODEL_VARIANT=ml docker compose up -d api`. The Grafana **Active variant** panel reflects the change within ~10 s.

## Notes on `handoff/`

The `handoff/` folder preserves the original Part 1 handoff artifacts for reference and compliance. It is not the runtime entrypoint for the Part 2 team project. Do not launch the system from `handoff/README.md` or `handoff/docker/compose.yaml`; use this root README and the root `docker-compose.yaml` instead.

## CI

CI runs lint (Black/Ruff) plus a replay integration smoke test that brings up the full Docker Compose stack inside the GitHub Actions runner. Deeper monitoring validation (Grafana panels, Prometheus scrape correctness, Kafka-exporter lag) is verified locally, not in CI, per instructor guidance.

Specifically, `.github/workflows/ci.yaml` runs two jobs on every push to `main` and on every pull request:

1. **`lint`** — runs `black --check` and `ruff check` across `api/` and `tests/`.
2. **`integration-replay`** — starts the Docker Compose stack, waits for `/health`, runs `pytest tests/test_replay_integration.py`, and tears down. This is the smoke-level integration gate; comprehensive multi-scenario load testing is validated locally before merge.

The CI does not attempt to reproduce the full production monitoring stack validation (Grafana panels, Prometheus scrape correctness, Kafka-exporter lag) in the GitHub Actions runner — those are covered by the local smoke test documented in [docs/runbook.md](docs/runbook.md).
